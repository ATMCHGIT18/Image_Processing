# Image_Processing
Welcome aboard. With the growing technologies out in the world, we have seen how important aspect Image Processing has become. This repository provides a complete understanding of practical implementation of all the concepts to be known for a developer to start their Image Processing journey.  

## A Glance into Image Processing
Image processing is often viewed as arbitrarily manipulating an image to achieve an aesthetic standard or to support a preferred reality. However, image processing is more accurately defined as a means of translation between the human visual system and digital imaging devices. The human visual system does not perceive the world in the same manner as digital detectors, with display devices imposing additional noise and bandwidth restrictions. Salient differences between the human and digital detectors will be shown, along with some basic processing steps for achieving translation. Image processing must be approached in a manner consistent with the scientific method so that others may reproduce, and validate, one's results. This includes recording and reporting processing actions, and applying similar treatments to adequate control images.[Src](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3635309/)

There are two types of methods used for image processing namely, analogue and digital image processing. Analogue image processing can be used for the hard copies like printouts and photographs. Image analysts use various fundamentals of interpretation while using these visual techniques. Digital image processing techniques help in manipulation of the digital images by using computers. The three general phases that all types of data have to undergo while using digital technique are  
  * Pre-processing
  * Enhancement and Display
  * Information Extraction.

**Important point** to note while going through any concept is that the image is considered on a grey scale since color increases the complexity of the model. One may want to introduce an image processing tool using gray level images because of the "format" of gray level images because the inherent complexity of gray level images is lower than that of color images. In most cases. after presenting a gray-level image method, it can be be extended to color images.

Forgetting deeper insights into any of the concepts, I suggest you to go through [Digital Image Processing, Rafael C. Gonzalez â€¢ Richard E. Woods, 4th Edition](https://github.com/BhanuPrakashNani/Image_Processing/blob/master/Digital_Image_Processing%2C_4th%20Edition-Rafael%20Gonzalez.pdf) 

The following is the order I suggest to look into the concepts.
