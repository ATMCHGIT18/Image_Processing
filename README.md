# Image_Processing
Welcome aboard. With the growing technologies out in the world, we have seen how important aspect Image Processing has become. This repository provides a complete understanding of practical implementation of all the concepts to be known for a developer to start their Image Processing journey.  

## A Glance into Image Processing
Image processing is often viewed as arbitrarily manipulating an image to achieve an aesthetic standard or to support a preferred reality. However, image processing is more accurately defined as a means of translation between the human visual system and digital imaging devices. The human visual system does not perceive the world in the same manner as digital detectors, with display devices imposing additional noise and bandwidth restrictions. Salient differences between the human and digital detectors will be shown, along with some basic processing steps for achieving translation. Image processing must be approached in a manner consistent with the scientific method so that others may reproduce, and validate, one's results. This includes recording and reporting processing actions, and applying similar treatments to adequate control images.[Src](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3635309/)

There are two types of methods used for image processing namely, analogue and digital image processing. Analogue image processing can be used for the hard copies like printouts and photographs. Various fundamentals of interpretation are used by the Image Analysts along with the visual techniques. Digital image processing deals with manipulation of digital images through a digital computer. It is a subfield of signals and systems but focus particularly on images. The three general phases that all types of data have to undergo while using digital techniques are  
  * Pre-processing
  * Enhancement and Display
  * Information Extraction.

**Important point** to note while going through any concept is that the image is considered on a grey scale since color increases the complexity of the model. One may want to introduce an image processing tool using gray level images because of the format of gray level images because the inherent complexity of gray level images is lower than that of color images. In most cases. after presenting a gray-level image method, it can be be extended to color images.

Forgetting deeper insights into any of the concepts, I suggest you to go through [Digital Image Processing, Rafael C. Gonzalez â€¢ Richard E. Woods, 4th Edition](https://github.com/BhanuPrakashNani/Image_Processing/blob/master/Digital_Image_Processing%2C_4th%20Edition-Rafael%20Gonzalez.pdf) 

From here on I will be referring Digital Image Processing as DIP.

The following is the order I suggest to look into the concepts.
### 1. Basics with Images - [Averaging Images](https://github.com/BhanuPrakashNani/Image_Processing/tree/master/Image%20Averaging)
Image averaging is a DIP technique that is used to enhance the images which are corrupted with random noise. The arithmetic mean of the intensity values for each pixel position is computed for a set of images of the same viewfield. The basic formula behind it is.  
![Image Averaging over set of N images](https://github.com/BhanuPrakashNani/Image_Processing/blob/master/images/averaging.png)  

### 2. Successive Rotations - [Code](https://github.com/BhanuPrakashNani/Image_Processing/tree/master/Successive%20Rotations)
The images are rotated using the self-defined code for rotation instead of the OpenCV inbuilt function. When an image is rotated by 45 degrees for 8 times, it does not produce the same result as when it is rotated by 90 degrees for 4 times. This is because, when an image is rotated 45 degrees, during the rotation more number of pixels values for the new position of the pixels is to be calculated. And calculating these new pixel positions and their intensities uses interpolation which are basically approximation methods. So when an image is rotated by 90 degrees there is a smoother transition since less no of approximations are to be made for the new pixel positions and their intensities. 

A clear example is shown below

### 3. Interpolations - [Code](https://github.com/BhanuPrakashNani/Image_Processing/tree/master/Interpolations)
Interpolation is used in tasks such as zooming, shrinking, rotating, and geometrically correcting digital images. It is the process of using known data to estimate values at unknown locations. So for giving the chance to estimate values, we will do some transformation, here it is rotation by 45 degrees. The 3 interpolations we see here are:

Nearest Neighbour         |  Bilinear         |  Bicubic
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:------------------:
![](https://github.com/BhanuPrakashNani/Image_Processing/blob/master/Interpolations/Nearest%20Neighbour.jpg)  |  ![](https://github.com/BhanuPrakashNani/Image_Processing/blob/master/Interpolations/Bilinear.jpg) | ![](https://github.com/BhanuPrakashNani/Image_Processing/blob/master/Interpolations/Bicubic.jpg)  

Here you can see a slight variation between the 3 images. The smoothness gets better from left to right. Since Bicubic interpolation uses a higher order equation it is able to capture features in depth.

### 4. Interpolation-Inverse Mapping - [Code](https://github.com/BhanuPrakashNani/Image_Processing/tree/master/Interpolation-Inverse%20Mapping)
As mentioned [here](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall00/cs426/papers/beier92.pdf), there are two methods of mapping, the first, called forward mapping, scans through the source image pixel by pixel, and copies them to the appropriate place in the destination image. The second, reverse mapping, goes through the destination image pixel by pixel, and samples the correct pixel from the source image. The most important feature of inverse mapping is that every pixel in the destination image gets set to something appropriate. In the forward mapping case, some pixels in the destination might not get painted, and would have to be interpolated. We calculate the image deformation as a reverse mapping.

### 5. Basic Transformations - [Code](https://github.com/BhanuPrakashNani/Image_Processing/tree/master/Basic%20Transformations)
We have seen the basic transformations like rotation and scaling. Now lets see one more basic transformation known as translation.

### 6. Perspective Transformation
The perspective transformation deals with the conversion of 3d world into 2d image for getting better insights about the required information. The 3D object co-ordinates are changed into the co-ordinates wrt world frame of reference and then according to camera coordiante frame reference then continued by changing into Image Plave 2D coordinates and then to the pixel co-ordinates.

### 7. Est. Transformation
This is just and example of using custom transformations for the required purpose. In the below example I have tried to extract the root part from the image.
